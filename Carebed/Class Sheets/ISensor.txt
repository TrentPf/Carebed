# Class Sheet: ISensor

**Namespace:** Carebed.Domain.Sensors

---

## Purpose
Defines the minimal contract for a sensor in the Carebed system. Implementations provide a snapshot of sensor data and support lifecycle management (start/stop/dispose).

---

## Interface Definition
```
internal interface ISensor : IDisposable
```

---

## Properties
- `string Source { get; }`
  - Logical source/id for the sensor (e.g., "Room A").

---

## Methods
- `SensorData ReadData()`
  - Reads a single snapshot of sensor data. Called by the SensorManager every poll cycle.
- `void Start()`
  - Starts periodic sampling if the sensor implements its own timer (optional).
- `void Stop()`
  - Stops periodic sampling (optional).
- `void Dispose()`
  - Releases resources used by the sensor.

---

## Usage Example
```csharp
public class TemperatureSensor : ISensor
{
    public string Source { get; }
    public SensorData ReadData() { /* ... */ }
    public void Start() { /* ... */ }
    public void Stop() { /* ... */ }
    public void Dispose() { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

## Notes
- Used by SensorManager to poll and manage sensors.
- Returns strongly-typed `SensorData` objects.
